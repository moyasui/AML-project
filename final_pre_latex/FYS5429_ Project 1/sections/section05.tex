\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

In this study, we focused on an exploration of how Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can be employed to understand and predict dynamics of systems ranging from stable (e.g. the stable spiral) to chaotic(e.g. the Lorenz attractor). 

Interestingly, LSTM RNNs were also proficient in studying less chaotic systems, like the stable spiral, which underlines their versatility and adaptability across diverse dynamic systems. However, in contrast to our initial hypothesis, the performance was not substantially better than that of the Lorenz attractor. Additionally, by incorporating physics-informed loss functions, we see an improvement of the results and obtained new insight to physics informed neural network. 

It became clear that training RNNs for chaotic dynamics is a challenging task, and conventional approaches may not be sufficient. We recognise that there is still room for improvement and further exploration.
