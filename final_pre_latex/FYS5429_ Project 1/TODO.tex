\section{MUST DO}
\begin{itemize}
    \item plot model history for epochs while training
    \item do the same thing we did to LSTM but with vanilla RNN 
    \item investigate why do we normalize. is it actually important? 
    \item physics inform (momemtum, energy conservation)
    \item \textbf{learn-rate, hidden, \kc{look-back, look-ahead}, optimiser, activation functions} for both SIMPLE-RNN, LSTM
    \item resampling/cross validation (how does one do it in time-series data?) - figure out, test and also write about 
    \item train on more trajectories
    \item should we write a parent class for simple-rnn and lstm since they have a lot of overlapping functions.
\end{itemize}


\section{EXTRA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item L2
    \item train on only (x,y) 
\end{itemize}
